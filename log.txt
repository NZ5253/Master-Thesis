Parallel Parking RL Training
Mode: curriculum
=========================================

Running CURRICULUM TRAINING (6 phases)
Training until each phase reaches success threshold
This is the RECOMMENDED approach for best results!

Phases:
  1. Foundation (70% success)
  2. Random Spawn (65% success)
  3. Random Bay X (60% success)
  4. Full Bay Random (60% success)
  5. Neighbor Jitter (55% success)
  6. Random Obstacles (50% success)
